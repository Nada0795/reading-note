# JavaScript Functions

* A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

* A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

### JavaScript Function Syntax
`` function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
} ``


## Function Return
* When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.


* Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller".


# Function definition & Function expressions :
** A function definition consists of the function keyword, followed by: **

1. #### The name of the function.
2. #### A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
3. #### The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.


** function declaration is syntactically a statement, functions can also be created by a function expression. **

* Such a function can be anonymous; it does not have to have a name.

* Function expressions are convenient when passing a function as an argument to another function.
