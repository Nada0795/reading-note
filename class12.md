# Chart.js, Canvas


### Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that
no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool.
They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

### A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, 
a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page.
 It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts,
line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.


### The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js.



## Creating a Chart
It's easy to get started with Chart.js. All that's required is the script included 
in your page along with a single < canvas > node to render the chart.
