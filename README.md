* A growth mindset is when the person understand his abilities and then developed it 
>The mindsets change what people strive for and what they see as success. . . they change the definition, significance, and impact of failure. . . they change the deepest meaning of effort.

**some of the reminders of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset :**
1. You must beleive in your self.
2. It's not how good  are you , it's how good you want to be.
3. Stop waiting for a Friday.
