# Structure HTML (page 12 -page 39)
* HTML pages are text documents.

* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled Xbrackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.

* Tags are often referred to as elements.

* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes Xthe start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.

* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more Xabout the content of that element.

* Attributes require a name and a value.

* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are Xavailable for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

* HTML elements are used to describe the structure of Xthe page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where Xemphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

# Extra Markup (page 176-page 199)
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.

* You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.

* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.

* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.

* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.

* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.

* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

# HTML5 Layout (page 428 - page 451)
* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

* The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).

* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.

* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google



# Process & Design (page 452-page 475)
* It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

* You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.

* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
