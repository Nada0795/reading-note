# IMAGES

### Three Rules for Creating Images : 

1. ** Save images in the right format **

Websites mainly use images in jpeg, gif, or png format. If you choose the wrong image format then your image might not look as sharp as it should and can make the web page slower to load.


2. ** Save images at the right size **
You should save the image at the same width and height it will appear on the website. If the image is smaller than the width or height that you have specified, the image can be distorted and stretched. If the image is larger than the width and height if you have specified, the image will take longer to display on the page



3. ** Use the correct resolution **

Computer screens are made up of dots known as pixels. Images used on the web are also made up of tiny dots. Resolution refers
to the number of dots per inch, and most computer screens only show web pages at 72 pixels
per inch. So saving images at a higher resolution results in images that are larger than
necessary and take longer to download.
 

* The < img > element is used to add images to a web page.

* You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.

* You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

* Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs


# COLOR
### You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:


1. ** rgb values **

These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)


2. ** hex codes **
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80




3. ** color names **
There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan



* Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.

* There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

* Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

* It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA


# TEXT
### The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:

1. Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)

2. Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters)



* There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.

* There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.

* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.

* You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.

* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
