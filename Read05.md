# *Expressions and operators

# OPERATORS
### JavaScript has many types of operators.
### Example : 

* Assignment operators
1. Addition assignment 
x += y Meaning x = x + y

2. Multiplication assignment
x *= y meaning x = x * y


* Comparison operators
1. Not equal (!=)
2. Strict equal (===)
3. Greater than (>)


* Bitwise operators
1. Bitwise AND a & b
2. Bitwise OR a | b

> AND MANY OTHER OPERATORS

> Logical operators

> String operators

> Conditional (ternary) operator

> Comma operator

> Unary operators

> Relational operators 

# EXPRESSIONS
## An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

### JavaScript has the following expression categories:

1. Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example 3.14159. 
2. String: evaluates to a character string, for example, "Fred" or "234".
3. Logical: evaluates to true or false.
4. Primary expressions: Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.
5. Left-hand-side expressions: Left values are the destination of an assignment.



# *For Statement & While Statement*
## * For Statement
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

### For Statement Syntax:
for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
 

* EXAMPLE :

for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
> OUTPUT IS:

>The number is 0

>The number is 1

>The number is 2

>The number is 3

>The number is 4


## * While Statement
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.

### While Statement Syntax:
while (condition)
  statement

  * EXAMPLE :

  while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}

> OUTPUT :

> The number is 0

> The number is 1

> The number is 2

> The number is 3

> The number is 4

> The number is 5

> The number is 6

> The number is 7

> The number is 8

> The number is 9
