# What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

# VSC
Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft.
It is available for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux
computers. VS Code has the Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS
already built-in with no additional work from you at all. VS Code has
everything: syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code
completion. It seems like VS Code has a very healthy following in the
web developing community.


## The Command Line!
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.
### 1. The First Command is **pwd**
It tells you what your current or present working directory is. Give it a try now.
### 2. the second command **IS**
Whereas pwd is just run by itself with no arguments, ls is a little more powerful. 
#### Example 

**ls [options] [ location
> In the above example, the square brackets ( [ ] ) mean that those items are optional, we may run the command with or without them.

### Absolute and Relative Paths
* There are 2 types of paths we can use, absolute and relative. Whenever we refer to a file or directory we are using one of these paths.

* Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )

* Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.


## 3. command **cd**

* cd [location]

this command may be run without a location as we saw in the shortcut above but usually will be run with a single command line argument which is the location we would like to change into. The location is specified as a path and as such may be specified as either an absolute or relative path.


## SUMMARY
* pwd
Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
* ls
List the contents of a directory.
* cd
Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.



# The Files :
### ( File : is obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is) .
### ( ls -a List the contents of a directory, including hidden files) .


### ( file [path] )

 * A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only) etc..

* file.exe - an executable file, or program.
* file.txt - a plain text file.
* file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.

* Everything is a file under Linux
Even directories.
* Linux is an extensionless system
Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
* Linux is case sensitive
Beware of silly typos.
