# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

> Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data .


## pure function : 
* It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).

* It does not cause any observable side effects


## Pure functions benefits
> The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:

* Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B

* Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D

## Functions as first-class entities
> The idea of functions as first-class entities is that functions are also treated as values and used as data.

### Functions as first-class entities can:
1. refer to it from constants and variables
2. pass it as a parameter to other functions
3. return it as result from other functions


## Higher-order functions
* This is mean a function that either:
1. takes one or more functions as arguments, or
2. returns a function as its result


## Filter
* A simple example is when we have a collection of integers and we want only the even numbers.

## Imperative approach
* An imperative way to do it with Javascript is to:

1. create an empty array evenNumbers
2. iterate over the numbers array
3. push the even numbers to the evenNumbers array
