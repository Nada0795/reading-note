# Tables

## Basic Table Structure

1. ### < table >
The < table > element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.

2. ### < tr >
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening < tr > tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more
< td > elements (one for each cell
in that row).
At the end of the row you use a
closing < /tr > tag.


3. ### < td >
Each cell of a table is
represented using a < td >
element.(The td stands for
table data.)



4. ### < th >
The < th > element is used just
like the < td > element but its
purpose is to represent the
heading for either a column or
a row. (The th stands for table
heading.) 


## Three Elements Of Table

1. ### < thead >
The headings of the table should
sit inside the < thead > element.

2. ### <tbody>
The body should sit inside the
< tbody > element.

3. ### < tfoot >
The footer belongs inside the
< tfoot > element.


* The < table > element is used to add tables to a web
page.

* A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the < tr > element.

* Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the < td > element (or < th > if it is a
header).

* You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.

* For long tables you can split the table into a < thead >,
< tbody >, and < tfoot >.


# Functions, Methods & Object

* Functions allow you to group a set of related 
statements together that represent a single task. 


* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required 
to do their job) and may return a value. 

* An object is a series of variables and functions that 
represent something from the world around you. 


* In an object, variables are known as properties of the 
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
 
* Web browsers implement objects that represent both 
the browser window and the document loaded into the 
browser window. 

* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as 
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and 
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 

*Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data 
sets (and both can contain the other).
