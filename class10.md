* Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a 
process of deduction. 

* The console helps narrow down the area in which the 
error is located, so you can try to find the exact error. 

* JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates 
its own error object, which can tell you its line number 
and gives a description of the error. 

* If you know that you may get an error, you can handle 
it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements. 
Use them to give your users helpful feedback.
