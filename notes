>Markdown & GitHub
I understood that the Markdown is like a library that we can use it to design all forms of writing on GitHub (format text).


when we design the website we can select all of files on the website and drop it in the GitHub and then getting a link of my page .


GitHub pages giving us way to share the pages with every one.


in the GitHub pages we can formatting syntax like (heading)
, styling text like (bold, italic ,....etc.)
links and emoji , table , images , ... etc
